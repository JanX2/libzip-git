  This is libzip, a C library for reading, creating, and modifying zip
archives.  Files can be added from data buffers, files, or compressed
data copied directly from other zip archives.  Changes made without
closing the archive can be reverted.  The API is documented by man
pages.

  For more information, take a look at the included man pages.  You
can start with libzip(3), which lists all others.  Example source code
is in the src/ subdirectory.

  For generic installation instructions, see file `INSTALL'.

  If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the
distribution site:
	http://www.nih.at/libzip/
	ftp.nih.at /pub/nih/libzip
The latest version can always be found there.
